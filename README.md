# Educational Project: Image Optimization and Responsive Web Design

## Repository Description
In this educational project, I focus on several important aspects of web development. I explore and apply the following concepts and techniques:

- **Sprites**: I study and implement sprites to combine multiple images into a single file. This helps reduce the number of server requests and improves page loading performance.

- **Image Optimization**: I learn various methods of optimizing images to reduce their size without sacrificing quality. I compress images, choose optimal file formats, and utilize tools for load optimization.

- **Pixel Perfect**: I strive for my web page to precisely match the provided design. I ensure exact dimensions, element positioning, and color consistency to achieve maximum accuracy in reproduction.

- **HTML5 Tags and Semantic Markup**: I utilize HTML5 tags and apply semantic markup to enhance accessibility, SEO optimization, and content comprehension by both humans and search engines.

- **Practice of Responsive and Adaptive Web Design**: I practice creating web pages that look and function well on different devices and screen resolutions. I employ media queries, flexible grids, and other techniques to achieve responsive and adaptive web design.

Happy coding!
